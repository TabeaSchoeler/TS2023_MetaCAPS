Rates and predictors of cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms: A meta-analysis synthesizing observational, experimental and medical research
================


# Overview

All analyses were performed in R. The complete analytical pipeline used to run the analyses is included in the script
[analysis.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/litSearch.R).

## Data

All study estimates analysed in this work are available [here](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/tree/main/data)

## Analytical scripts

The following analytical scripts are available:

1) [functions.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/functions.R): Script including all derived functions used to perform the analyses
2) [litSearch.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/litSearch.R): Script to conduct the systematic literature research in R 
3) [runMeta.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/runMeta.R): Script to process the extracted [data](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/tree/main/data) and perform meta-analyses on rates and predictors of CAPS
4) [createTable.R](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/blob/main/analysis/createTable.R): Script to generate [supplementary tables](https://github.com/TabeaSchoeler/TS2023_MetaCAPS/tree/main/results/tables/)

### Systematic literature search

#### Figure 1. Number of included studies and study participants per study design, according to year of publication

<img src="results/figures/yearSearch.png" alt="A caption" width="100%" />

Number of included studies per year of publication and study design, including (1) observational research assessing recreational cannabis users, (2) experimental studies administering tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in healthy volunteers and (3) medical studies assessing adverse events in individuals taking cannabis products for medicinal use. Quasi-experimental research involved research testing the effects of THC administration in a naturalistic setting
